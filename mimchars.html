        Megan Is Missing Characters
    </h1>
    
<div class="character">
    <img src="hgcharacters/mim/megan.JPG" alt="megan" class="charimage-left">
    <div class="charcontent-left">
        <p class="charheader-left">Megan Stewart</p>
        <p class="chardesc-left">THE final girl. A staple in the HG and MIM universes, Megan is an eccentric character filled with lots of lore, laughs, and love. We adore her greatly.</p>
        </div>

<div class="character character-reverse">
    <img src="hgcharacters/mim/amy.PNG" alt="amy" class="charimage-right">
    <div class="charcontent-right">
        <p class="charheader-right">Amy Herman</p>
        <p class="chardesc-right">Do we stan? Well...sorta kinda. Made awful decisions, kinda hard to root for her. At least her and Megan were reunited in the end though.</p>

<div class="character">
    <img src="hgcharacters/mim/josh.JPG" alt="josh" class="charimage-left">
    <div class="charcontent-left">
        <p class="charheader-left">Josh Pitt</p>
        <p class="chardesc-left">He was a skater boy, Megan and Amy should've said see ya later boy. No shade.</p>
        </div>

<div class="character character-reverse">
    <img src="hgcharacters/mim/lexie.PNG" alt="lexie" class="charimage-right">
    <div class="charcontent-right">
        <p class="charheader-right">Lexie Stewart</p>
        <p class="chardesc-right">She had her gags so she gets her -1s. Overacting and blaming Amy for Megan being missing kinda sent me especially when she set Megan up with Josh lolz. But streets saying she did that out of jealousy because she was in love with Megan. Lowkey most complex character, but also a Khia so we move.</p>
